I see that you've uploaded an image with a table outlining various tasks and their corresponding actions for web and desktop applications. Based on this, I'll generate REST API endpoints for these tasks.

Here's a possible structure:

### **Endpoints for Subject (`tant√°rgy`)**
- **Create & Read Subject**
  - `POST /subjects` (Request body: subject details)
  - `GET /subjects/{id}` (Retrieve subject details)
  
- **Delete Subject**
  - `DELETE /subjects/{id}`
  
- **Update Subject**
  - `PUT /subjects/{id}` (Request body: updated details)

---

### **Endpoints for Teacher (`tan√°r`)**
- **Create & Read Teacher**
  - `POST /teachers/register` (Request body: teacher details, requires approval)
  - `GET /teachers/{id}` (Retrieve teacher details)
  
- **Delete Teacher**
  - `DELETE /teachers/{id}`
  
- **Update Teacher**
  - `PUT /teachers/{id}` (Request body: updated details)

---

### **Endpoints for Student (`di√°k`)**
- **Create & Read Student**
  - `POST /students` (Request body: student details)
  - `GET /students/{id}` (Retrieve student details)
  
- **Delete Student**
  - `DELETE /students/{id}`
  
- **Update Student**
  - `PUT /students/{id}` (Request body: updated details)

---

### **Endpoints for Events (`esem√©ny`)**
- **Student Requesting a Time Slot from a Teacher**
  - `POST /appointments/request` (Request body: student ID, teacher ID, requested time)
  
- **Teacher Approving or Rejecting Request**
  - `PUT /appointments/{id}/approve` (Approve appointment request)
  - `PUT /appointments/{id}/reject` (Reject appointment request)

Each of these would follow standard authentication based on email & password.

Would you like me to refine any part or add authentication details? üöÄ
